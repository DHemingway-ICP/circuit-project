## ⚙️ Overview
Circuit is a decentralized suite of autonomous Internet Computer (ICP) applications unified through a parent dashboard, **Circuit Hub**.  
Each app operates independently but follows a shared structure, design system, and API interface to provide seamless integration.

**Core Principles**
- Privacy-first, user-owned data  
- Modular design with shared schemas  
- Transparency and verifiability through blockchain logic  
- Minimal dependencies for ease of deployment
